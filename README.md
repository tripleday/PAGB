Privacy-preserving Accumulator for Graphs in Blockchain

Implementation is based on https://github.com/oleiba/RSA-accumulator

The data owner outsources the graph data to the cloud and sends prime representatives to the blockchain (the cloud as well for generating proofs).

Datasets include
* https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-CondMat.html
simple directed graph, social network
* https://sparse.tamu.edu/vanHeukelum/cage15
directed weighted graph, biological network
* http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/
knowledge graph
